How the stock market works?
Every listed company issues shares to public via IPO, open market etc.
share face value will be ₹1, ₹10 some times higher also.
If you want to buy a share of Infosys at the market price ₹1910 (20.09.2024) there should be a seller in open market.
You can buy the infosys share at lower price also , but need to wait till the price to lower. 

There are 3 balances in your account, 
Cash Balance - Un used balance
Holding Balance - value of shares
Overall Balance - Sum of both above
